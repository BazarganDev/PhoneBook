# PhoneBook
A command-line based Phonebook using Python

## About
PhoneBook is a program that you can:

  - Add contacts
  - Delete contacts
  - Search a specific contact
  - Check the phonebook

The code behind it is simple and not complecated but great for sharpening your skills as a Python programmer.

You can run the program from the terminal or by double clicking on the "main.py" (I personally recommend the second way).

## Attention
Please keep the "main.py" and "phonebook.py" together in the same directory to avoid any troubles with importing the "phonebook.py" module.

In "phonebook.py" file at line 5, you have to set an address to save the "phonebook.txt" in that directory.

"phonebook.py", Line 5:
```
phonebook = r"PATH_TO_CREATE_AND_SAVE_THE_PHONEBOOK_FILE"
```

Set the path to save the file that contains contacts
